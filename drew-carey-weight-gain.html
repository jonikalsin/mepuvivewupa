The 64-year-old apparently underwent a significant weight loss this year, and viewers are comparing photos of him from when he had a massive weight and after this alleged weight loss. Drew lost weight mostly as a result of his heart attack and subsequent type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Here is everything we know about Drew Carey's weight gain, so far.</strong></p><p><strong>Carey, Drew Allison</strong> (born on May 23, 1958) is a <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>comedian</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>actor</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>game show host</a></strong> from the United States who rose to prominence in his own ABC sitcom, The Drew Carey Show, and as the presenter of the American version of the improv comedy series Whose Line Is It Anyway? after serving in the U.S. Marine Corps and establishing himself in stand-up comedy.</p><p>Since then, he made appearances in a number of movies, TV shows, music videos, a made-for-TV movie, and video games. Since October 15, 2007, he has hosted The Price Is Right on CBS.</p><p>Carey has experience working as a photographer at U.S. National Team soccer matches and is interested in a number of sports. He has a small ownership stake in the Seattle Sounders FC, a Major League Soccer team that has won the MLS Cup twice, first in 2016 and once in 2019. In 2001, Carey most memorably competed in the Royal Rumble. He briefly engaged in professional wrestling, and in 2011 he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.</p><p>WWE Hall of Fame, Drew Carey has recently lost weight and fans are wondering why The Price Is Right host underwent the transformation. Well, here's everything we have on Drew Carey's weight gain!</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight gain</a></strong> efforts of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Gina Carano</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Chris Brown</a></strong>.</p><h2>Drew Carey's Weight Gain: The Drew Carey Show Host Had a Massive Heart Attack Which Changed Everything!</h2><p>Many people struggle with weight gain and the desire to shed weight. For them, weight gain is a serious concern. Every single person has personal issues that they must address, including their weight issues.</p><p><strong>Drew Carey</strong> also once had a <a href=# rel=noopener>massive</a> weight gain after the 64-year-old actor narrowly escaped a massive heart attack in August, and he subsequently had an angioplasty procedure to open a clogged artery in his heart. After that, he started taking care of his health realizing that he should take proper care of his health.</p><p>Carey, who was roughly <strong>240 pounds</strong> when he experienced the fright, is aware that he should have taken better care of himself over the years and that being overweight mostly affects one's mental health. They are always concerned about their health, but it took a severe heart attack for Drew Carey to realize that he had a massive weight gain.</p><p>Carey experienced chest aches and tingling in his arms and shoulders while jogging. By the time he arrived home, he said that the discomfort had subsided but that his chest still felt tight.</p><p>The 64-year-old comedian was so shaken and angry that he had chili spaghetti that evening at Bob's Big Boy, steak and eggs for breakfast the next morning, and didn't even mention his chest symptoms to his doctor when he went in for a medical that day.</p><p>He believed that the pains might have just been caused by stress. The pain returned after a full day of rehearsal and was worse than ever. He walked to his trailer and almost passed out there. Carey recognized he was in good hands when the nurse's lab coat included an image of Bugs Bunny holding a stethoscope when the paramedics arrived at his trailer on the <span><a href=# rel=noopener>Warner Bros</a> </span>set.</p><p>Carey had angioplasty, a procedure that effectively uses a tiny balloon encased with a spring called a stent to pry free the clogged artery. Carey was at high risk due to his high cholesterol, poor eating habits, and extra weight because heart disease runs in his family.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>He claimed that he was not terrified of dying, despite the fact that Carey's event had shocked him into altering his lifestyle. After that, he began to care about his health, but before, despite having a massive weight gain, he had no interest in it.</p><h2>Drew Careyâ€™s Weight Loss Journey: What Triggered the Price Is Right Host to Lose Weight?</h2><p>Following his heart attack, comedian<strong> Drew Carey</strong>, 64, was also diagnosed a type 2 diabetes, which brought up his weight gain problem once more. He has made his weight a humorous subject in all of his sitcoms and improved appearances. But this time, he had a son, and he was determined to live long enough to see him graduate from high school, so it was a serious situation.</p><p>Drew Carey had put on a significant amount of weight prior to terminating his marriage, and it was quite challenging for him to shed it all.</p><p>Additionally, he had tried a number of diets and physical activities, but none of them had shown to be effective. Drew Carey made the decision to have cosmetic surgery in the fall of 2022 in order to lose those extra <strong>8 pounds</strong>.</p><p>According to press releases issued by People and other news organizations, a photographer who was photographing his daughter's class in New York had discovered Drew Carey there, and during the course of the photo shoot, he was able to lose the extra ten pounds.</p><p>He had tried jogging, cycling, yoga, water aerobics, and all other forms of exercise, but to no avail. He ultimately had to have gastric band surgery.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGibq52nYrCivsSyZLCdmZy1tXnGmqCnZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdrew-carey-weight-gain.html&text=The%20Time%20When%20He%20Weighed%20240%20Pounds%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdrew-carey-weight-gain.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdrew-carey-weight-gain.html&title=The%20Time%20When%20He%20Weighed%20240%20Pounds%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdrew-carey-weight-gain.html&title=The%20Time%20When%20He%20Weighed%20240%20Pounds%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdrew-carey-weight-gain.html&title=The%20Time%20When%20He%20Weighed%20240%20Pounds%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdrew-carey-weight-gain.html&description=The%20Time%20When%20He%20Weighed%20240%20Pounds%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-the-rollerworld-money-in-on-my-block.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened to the Rollerworld Money in On My Block?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sky-ferreira.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sky Ferreira - CelebNetWorth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
