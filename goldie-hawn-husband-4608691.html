The 76-year-old actress has everything from box office smashes to an Academy Award under her belt and she’s still starring in major movies like the upcoming Family Jewels, which reunites Goldie with her The First Wives Club co-stars <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bette Midler</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Diane Keaton</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Born in Washington D.C., Goldie took her bubbly personality and comedic chops to Los Angeles after working as a professional dancer. She quickly found fame as a regular cast member on the sketch comedy show <i>Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In. </i>Then in her very first outing as a film actor, Goldie took home the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1969’s Cactus Flower! She was again nominated for an Oscar in 1980, this time for Best Actress in Private Benjamin. She also had hits with Bird On A Wire, Death Becomes Her and The Banger Sisters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/goldie-hawn-kurt-russell-husbands-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Outside of her immensely successful Tinseltown career, Goldie has maintained a healthy love life. She was first married to <strong>Gus Trikonis</strong>, then to <strong>Bill Hudson</strong> and finally has enjoyed a decades-long romance with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kurt Russell</strong></a>. Find out all about her relationships, below.</p><h2>Gus Trikonis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/goldie-hawn-kurt-russell-husbands-Gus-Trikonis-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Born in New York on November 21, 1937, Gus began his career in Hollywood as a dancer, and he played Indio, a member of the Sharks gang in 1961’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>West Side Story</a>. &nbsp;He would soon turn his talents to directing, with his first movie being the 1969 biker classic Five the Hard Way, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDB</a>. The same year, Gus married Goldie on May 16 in Honolulu, Hawaii. After a string of directing low-budget fare such as The Student Body and The Swinging Barmaids, Gus found his relationship with Goldie deteriorating. They separated on April 9, 1973 but didn’t finalize their divorce until June 1976.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Later in his career, Gus found success directing Take This Job and Shove It and several made-for-TV movies. He also began directing for TV shows, working on Baywatch, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Quantum Leap, The Commishand Hunter.</p><h2>Bill Hudson</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Bill was born in born on October 17, 1949 in Portland, Orgeon. He first met Hawn on a flight from New York to Los Angeles in 1975 when he was in a band, the Hudson Brothers, with his real-life brothers <strong>Brett</strong> and <strong>Mark</strong>. The band toured with the <strong>Osmonds</strong> and <strong>David Cassidy</strong>. Bill and Goldie would marry on July 3, 1976. They welcomed son <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oliver Hudson</a> on September 7, 1976 and daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kate Hudson</a> on April 19, 1979. The marriage wouldn’t last and Bill filed for divorce on August 15, 1980.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Since then, Bill’s relationship with Goldie and their two children has been strained. In a 2011 interview, Bill slammed Goldie for pitting Oliver and Kate against him once she started dating Kurt. “When we split up, she never had a bad word to say about me,” Bill told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>. “But when Kurt came on the scene, the narrative changed and I became the big, bad wolf. I would say to her ‘Goldie, why are you trashing me and saying I’m an absent father when it’s simply not the case?’ and she’d laugh and go ‘Oh Bill, you know it makes for a better story.’”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Meanwhile, Oliver and Kate have been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>outspoken about being estranged</a> from their biological father, often saying he abandoned them. They publicly praise Kurt as stepping up as a father figure during their childhood.</p><h2>Relationship With Kurt Russell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/goldie-hawn-kurt-russell-husbands-bill-hudson-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Goldie and Kurt’s relationship has definitely defied Hollywood odds. The lovebirds first met on the set of the 1968 film, The One And Only, Genuine, Original Family Band, when she was 21 and he was just 16. But it wasn’t until they found themselves working together again — filming 1983’s Swing Shift — that they decided to try their hand at a romance. Although it could have <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gone horribly wrong.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“I was severely <span data-scayt_word=hungover data-scaytid=9>hungover</span>,” Kurt hilariously told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Conan O’Brien</strong> </a>about the first time he asked Goldie on a date. “I just didn’t have in my mind what I was going to see. She had a great body, and so the first that came out was ‘Man, you’ve got a great figure.’ It kind of came out quickly, and it could’ve been wrong, and she said, ‘Why, thank you.’”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Goldie appeared to love the line, as she told<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> in 2020,&nbsp;“I remember about Kurt, not only being really sexy and handsome and all that stuff, and fun — a good co-star. I loved the way he looked at my children. It was really something special and that was…he’s good with kids. And I kind of went, ‘Oh my god. This is amazing.’”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>In a July 2023 interview with CNN’s <strong>Chris Wallace</strong>, Goldie offered up an explanation for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>why she’s never married Kurt</a>. “When it doesn’t work out, it ends up to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>be big business,” </a>she said during the interview.&nbsp; It’s always ugly. Somebody actually has to<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> take a look</a> and say, ‘How many divorces actually are fun? How many divorces actually <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>don’t cost money</a>? How many divorces actually make you hate the person more than you did before? How many divorces have hurt children?”‘</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>She also shared that she appreciates being able to make a conscious choice to stay in her longtime relationship. “I like the idea that I can wake up in the morning and make decisions every day if I want to be here,” she explained. “I mean relationships are hard. They’re not always easy. There’s all kinds of hurdles we go through. There’s things that we believe in, things we don’t believe in, we agree on. So I think ultimately staying independent with independent thinking is important, so you can hold on to yourself, and you can actually have that feeling.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>While Goldie had Oliver and Kate, Kurt also had son&nbsp;<strong>Boston </strong>from his former marriage with <strong>Season Hubley. </strong>Soon Goldie and Kurt added to their family, as they welcomed Wyatt in 1986. They now have seven grandchildren. And the rest is blissful, Hollywood history!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8aoo52hlWK1osPNZp%2Buq5KWu6V5k29ncW5pZnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgoldie-hawn-husband-4608691.html&text=Everything%20To%20know%20About%20Her%202%20Marriages%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgoldie-hawn-husband-4608691.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgoldie-hawn-husband-4608691.html&title=Everything%20To%20know%20About%20Her%202%20Marriages%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgoldie-hawn-husband-4608691.html&title=Everything%20To%20know%20About%20Her%202%20Marriages%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgoldie-hawn-husband-4608691.html&title=Everything%20To%20know%20About%20Her%202%20Marriages%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgoldie-hawn-husband-4608691.html&description=Everything%20To%20know%20About%20Her%202%20Marriages%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fitforcalis.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fitforcalis-Bio, Age, Single, Nationality, Facts, Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./babyname.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vivian - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
