And I just remembered thinking she's from Texas and we both loved our parents and we had a lot in common at that time. I remember thinking, "I like this girl," never thinking that we'd go on and be on a show together. It was just that we were two girls doing a Max Factor commercial who had a lot in common. I liked her. She was sweet. She was interesting. She wasn't the typical actress. I think part of our success was we weren't competitive or desperate for screen time. We liked one another.

She and Farrah had considered it a prestigious honor when "Time" magazine asked, but Kate balked at it, since the producers wanted them to give up their lunch hour to do it. She had frequently stopped the producers from overworking them and saw this as one more way for them to encroach on their personal time. She locked herself in her trailer with Farrah and Jaclyn and told the producers that the door was stuck and won't open. The three friends had their lunch together for 45 minutes, when the producers struggled to open the door and begged them to pose for "Time" magazine, which they did in the last 15 minutes of their lunch hour.
