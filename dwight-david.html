Because of his lack of success in Nashville, he traveled to Los Angeles in the 1980s, where he sought to establish his style of modern Honky Tonk or “Hillbilly” <a href=#>music</a>.</p><p>The Blasters, Los Lobos, and X were among the roots-rock and punk rock bands with whom Dwight Yoakam played, and he created all of his songs. He continued to perform outside of the typical country music channels, doing numerous gigs in rock and punk rock venues around Los Angeles.</p><p>In this way, he broadened his following beyond the average country music listeners, and his honest, honky-tonk revivalism drew rock audiences closer to<a href=#> country music</a>. Hip honky-tonk music was regarded as unmarketable in Nashville when he first started in the music business.</p><p>Yoakam relocated to Los Angeles after failing to gain traction in Nashville, where he honed his unique kind of modern Honky Tonk or “Hillbilly” music (as he dubbed it). Pete Anderson’s self-financed EP on Oak Records served as Yoakam’s big-label debut LP, 1986’s Guitars, Cadillacs, re-issued by Reprise Records, with many more songs released in the same year.</p><p>Records like Dwight Yoakam’s honky-tonk influenced songs were becoming more popular at the time, while urban cowboy music was falling out of favor in favor of the more conventional neotraditional country. A duet with his musical hero, Buck Owens, on “Streets of Bakersfield” appeared on his third studio album, Buenas from a Lonely Room. The book If There Was a Way, published in 1990, was a huge success.</p><p>To honor his boyhood relocation from Kentucky, Yoakam’s song “Reading'” takes its title from a local word indicating the road taken by rural Kentuckians seeking work outside of the coal industry. Elvis Presley-style rockabilly tunes, such as “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” by Queen and “Suspicious Minds” by Elvis Presley, are among the numerous songs he has written or recorded, along with his honky-tonk and bluegrass background.</p><p>In 1997, he recorded a version of “Train in Vain” by the Clash, as well as “Truckin'” by the Grateful Dead and “I Want You to Want Me” by Cheap Trick. In his later releases, he experimented with various genres, including rock ‘n’ roll, punk, 1960s blues-based “boogie” like ZZ Top, and more experimental songs like “A Thousand Miles From Nowhere,” which he covered and wrote.</p><p>He lent his voice to Warren Zevon’s last album, The Wind, in 2003. Yoakam’s solo acoustic CD dwightyoakamacoustic.net was published in 2000 and had several of his biggest songs. Blame the Vain was released by New West Records in 2005 and was well-received. Dwight Sings Buck, a tribute album to Buck Owens, was released on October 23, 2007. “Long Goodbye,” a duet with Michelle Branch, was offered as a free download on her website in early 2011.</p><p>Re-signing with Warner Bros. Nashville in July 2011, Dwight Yoakam revealed plans for a new album. On September 18, 2012, 3 Pears, a collection of twelve brand-new songs, was released. It has a collaboration with Beck, which he produced. NPR, Rolling Stone, American Songwriter, AOL’s The Boot, Entertainment Weekly, The Village Voice, and Rhapsody all listed it in their annual best-of lists for 2012, making it the most-cited country artist on these lists.</p><p>“Guitars, Cadillacs” was voted No. 94 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 100 best country songs in June 2014. Yoakam revealed in February 2015 that he would be releasing a new studio album on April 14, 2015, titled Second Hand Heart. In 2016, he performed at the C2C: Country to the Country event in Europe to promote the record. It was announced that he was working on an all-bluegrass album at the Americana Music Honors & Awards.</p><p>Swimming Pools and Movie Stars were launched in September of this year. The LSD Tour, including Yoakam, Lucinda Williams, and Steve Earle, kicked up in 2018.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Film and TV Career of Dwight Yoakam</h3><p>Yoakam has starred in several films, including Sling Blade (1996) as an aggressive live-in lover, Panic Room (2002) as a psychopath murderer, The Minus Man (1999) as a police investigator, and The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada (2001) as the sheriff (2005).</p><p>In Crank (2006) and its follow-up, Crank: High Voltage, he played Doc Miles, Chev Chelios’s doctor (2009).
