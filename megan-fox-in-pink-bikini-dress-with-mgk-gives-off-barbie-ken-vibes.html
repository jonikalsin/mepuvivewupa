Rapinoe and Co. will then travel to Chicago to face the Red Stars at SeatGeek Stadium on October 15.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>OL Reign head coach, Laura Harvey, included Rapinoe in her team’s starting line-up, with the 38-year-old named on the left wing, where she’s scored two goals and has registered 5 assists across 14 matches played this season. The Reign are the No. 6 seed of the NWSL – the last postseason birth – and just a point behind the Spirit – the No. 5 ranked team. They could be in serious danger of missing the playoffs if they lose against both, or either, Washington and Chicago.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rapinoe will be hoping to win her last home game with her club after her time with the U.S. women’s national team ended abruptly in August. The forward was among three U.S. players to have missed a penalty kick in a Round of 16 loss to Sweden – the team’s worst-ever finish at the tournament in history.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Hey Megan! It’s Billie Jean [King],’ said the 12-time Grand Slam winner in a tribute video for Rapinoe shown prior to kick-off on Friday. ‘You’re a legend and a leader! And we’re looking forward to the next part of your journey.’&nbsp;</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async id=i-5333f15aebfa7193 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/07/02/76268701-0-image-a-7_1696642989363.jpg height=425 width=634 alt="Megan Rapinoe was honored prior to her last home game for the OL Reign in Seattle on Friday" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Megan Rapinoe was honored prior to her last home game for the OL Reign in Seattle on Friday</p><img decoding=async id=i-ccd399872e5a71c2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/07/02/76268695-0-image-a-3_1696642897465.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Fans honored Rapinoe by wearing pink hair wigs and setting a NWSL attendance record (33k)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Fans honored Rapinoe by wearing pink hair wigs and setting a NWSL attendance record (33k)</p><img decoding=async id=i-bbdef081948c37fb src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/07/02/76268709-0-image-m-6_1696642917967.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Rapinoe&nbsp;warms up before her last regular-season home game against the Washington Spirit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Rapinoe&nbsp;warms up before her last regular-season home game against the Washington Spirit</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>”Pinoe, what can I say…you did it all!’ then said Abby Wambach – the highest all-time goal scorer in U.S. women’s national team history. ‘You were a part of the biggest games, biggest moments. You won the biggest championships multiple times. You won all the individual awards that you possibly could and to top that all off, you and the team were able to secure equal pay.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rapinoe has been involved in the women’s team’s equal pay complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission since at least 2016. In March 2019, she, along with 27 of her U.S. Women’s soccer teammates filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation accusing it of gender discrimination, hoping to achieve equal pay.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In May of the following year, a judge dismissed key parts of the lawsuit including the complaint over receiving lower pay than the U.S. men’s team but allowed other claims to move to trial.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rapinoe has been a longtime advocate for the inclusion of transgender women in women’s sports, and has characterized the issue as being part of a larger effort to ‘legislate away people’s full humanity.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>British-American broadcaster Roger Bennett – host of NBC’s Men in Blazers – praised Rapinoe’s ‘courage’, adding that she’s ‘unafraid’ and ‘unapologetic.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A footballer who transcended our soccer bubble,’ Bennett further said, while three-time Olympic gold medalist and skier Mikaela Sheffrin, First Gentleman Doug Enhoff and former Seattle Mariners outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. also joined in celebrating the two-time World Cup winner’s career.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Commanders minority owner and basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson, ex-U.S. women’s soccer teammate Ali Krieger and Rapinoe’s siblings, Rachael and Austin, as well as her parents, Jim and Denise, also paid tribute to the 2012 London Olympics gold medalist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async id=i-aead8b1526f10710 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/07/02/76268853-12604305-image-a-25_1696643799593.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Fans honored Rapinoe at Lumen Field on Friday by displaying gigantic banners in the stands" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Fans honored Rapinoe at Lumen Field on Friday by displaying gigantic banners in the stands&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr xml:lang=en>“She gives you the platform to think you can be whatever you want”</p><p>Not many players have had their head coaches in tears like this.
