She has stayed out of the limelight for the better part of their relationship, working in the background and supporting her husband in his endeavors. However, Julia is her own woman too, an actress, producer, and has featured in such projects as “Enemy at the Door”, and “Within These Walls”, among others.</p><p>So, do you want to find out more about Julia Carey, from her childhood years to most recent endeavors, including her personal life? If yes, then stay with us for the length of the article as we introduce you to the wife of James Corden.</p><p></p><h3><span id=Julia_Carey_Wiki_Age_Childhood_and_Education>Julia Carey Wiki: Age, Childhood, and Education</span></h3><p>Julia Carey was born in 1976 in the USA, however, she hasn’t revealed more about her childhood to the public, and as a result, the names and vocations of her parents remain unknown to the present day, also whether she has any siblings or not. To speak further of her secretive nature, Julia hasn’t shared details about her educational background. Hopefully, Julia becomes more open about her life before she became a celebrity, and shares some information with her fans.</p><h3><span id=Julia_Carey_Career>Julia Carey Career</span></h3><p>Julia’s career is nowhere near as successful as her husband’s, however, she has still contributed to the entertainment world as a producer and actress. She has made a few notable appearances, such as in <a rel=nofollow href=#>TV series</a> “A Bunch of Fives”, then “Enemy at the Door”, “Wings”, and “Within These Walls”. However, it wasn’t her career that made her popular, but her relationship with James Corden. Since the marriage, Julia has focused more on raising their children and supporting James in his endeavors, rather than pursuing her own career. James has dedicated almost all his awards to his wife as a way of thanking her for her support and all that she has done for him and the family over the years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/julia-carey-1024x512.jpg><h3><span id=Relationship_with_James_Corden_Marriage_Wedding_Children>Relationship with James Corden, Marriage, Wedding, Children</span></h3><p>Julia and James met in 2009 at a party of a mutual friend; it was Dominic Cooper who introduced the two to one another, and it turned out to be a great idea. James was going through a tough break-up at the time, and Julia seemed perfect for him. They hit it off almost immediately, and spent the rest of the party talking to each other. Less than a year later the couple was already engaged – at the time of James’ proposal, Julia was already pregnant with their first child. The wedding ceremony was held on the 15th September 2012 at Babington House in Somerset, and according to reports, the ceremony cost a stunning £250,000, with some of the guests including Matt Smith, Jimmy Carr, Lara Stone and David Williams, while Gary Lightbody was one of the singers at the wedding. Since the wedding, the couple has welcomed two more children, and they are now parents of three, a son Max, and daughters Carey, and Charlotte born in 2014 and 2017 respectively.</p><h3><span id=Julia_Corden_Net_Worth>Julia Corden Net Worth</span></h3><p>Although she hasn’t become as popular as her husband, Julia’s achievements have certainly contributed to her net worth.
