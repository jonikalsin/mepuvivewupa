During the bout, Ric’s attendants, Woman, and Miss Elizabeth chased Debra and Kevin’s wife to the back. Jarrett was expelled from the Horsemen,</p><p>and Debra soon left Steve&nbsp;for Jarrett in July 1997. On the 21st August episode of “Clash of the Champions XXXV,” Steve gained his revenge by defeating Jarrett for his WCW United States Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>In November 1997, Debra hired Goldberg to find Steve, and he became one of Goldberg’s first victims. Goldberg stole McMichael’s Super Bowl ring, which he returned weeks later after hitting him with a pipe.</p><p>They had a feud with the nWo until McMichael’s final appearance on “Nitro” on February 8, 1999. Later, at Total Nonstop Action Wrestling’s premier pay-per-view,</p><p>Bound For Glory, Steve returned to professional wrestling to referee the Monster’s Ball Match. His extraordinarily sluggish cadence for a three-count was remarkable in this match.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements>Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Misty McMichael has black eyes with blonde hair color.
