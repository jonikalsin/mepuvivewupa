Fans thought Jasmina and Michael’s match was one of the best on the program right away.</p><p>Jasmina is a kindergarten teacher. She joined up for the program in order to find love and heal from previous traumas caused by family infidelity and relationships. Michael is a personal trainer who is sick of searching for love on dating apps. He’s looking for better success on the program.</p><h2>Jasmina and Michael from ‘Married at First Sight’ are dealing with post-wedding anxieties.</h2><p>Jasmina had a nervous breakdown when she joined Married at First Sight. She felt terrific in the days leading up to the wedding, but she got cold feet and collapsed on the wedding day. When she saw Michael at the altar, she calmed down.&nbsp;Jasmina started to worry and become suspicious when she chatted with Michael more after the ceremony on Married at First Sight and throughout the wedding celebration.</p><p>Michael admitted to having a strict sleep routine. He describes himself as a “grandpa” who goes to bed at 9.00 p.m. However, Jasmina loves to stay up later to watch Korean dramas. During their wedding reception, Michael confessed in a confessional:</p><p>“Loss was a part of my family’s life as I grew up, and it influenced everything.” So it’s been challenging to figure out how to let people in, but I’m looking for love. I’m seeking for someone to accompany me. I knew I had to take a major risk in order for it to happen, and I’m pleased I did.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Michael-Morency-1-1.jpg alt="Michael Morency" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Jasmina’s concerns were compounded when she learned about Michael’s work schedule. Michael said that he had a rigorous work schedule and little leisure time. Jasmina expressed concern that he would not have time to cultivate the connection. She stated:</p><p>“In my previous relationships, I had a poor history of being with individuals who were just emotionally absent.” I deserve someone who will prioritize me and is really interested in the same things that I am. Marriage is not a joke in my opinion. It’s something I take extremely seriously.”</p><h2>Michael’s actions on the program fueled the flames.</h2><p>Jasmina and Michael had a talk at the start of episode 5 of Married at First Sight in which Michael believed the pair had drifted apart. He wanted to see greater growth in their relationship.&nbsp;Michael’s propensity of thinking the worst in every scenario was then explored by the Married at First Sight pair. Jasmina said that it frightens her. Michael said that he took it seriously since this was a one-of-a-kind circumstance. Because he didn’t want to ruin their relationship, he kept overthinking and assuming the worst.</p><p>When Michael asked Jasmina to apologize for cutting him off during their talk with others on the boat, it was the breaking point for her. Michael believed that Jasmina’s reaction of “I am sorry you felt that way” was not an apology, so the pair addressed it over dinner.&nbsp;Because she had not cut him off, Jasmina refused to apologize. His impolite manner irritated her. Michael apologized and said that he has been working on being less violent.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikopuYlrKtecyoqZ6mk67AbrvNZquhnV2otbDDjKaYq6qZmrFurdNmnaKqo6l6tLXGoato</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichael-morencys-on-the-show-married-at-first-sight.html&text=Michael%20Morencys%20Behavior%20On%20The%20Show%20Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Added%20Fuel%20To%20The%20Fire&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-morencys-on-the-show-married-at-first-sight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-morencys-on-the-show-married-at-first-sight.html&title=Michael%20Morencys%20Behavior%20On%20The%20Show%20Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Added%20Fuel%20To%20The%20Fire" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichael-morencys-on-the-show-married-at-first-sight.html&title=Michael%20Morencys%20Behavior%20On%20The%20Show%20Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Added%20Fuel%20To%20The%20Fire" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-morencys-on-the-show-married-at-first-sight.html&title=Michael%20Morencys%20Behavior%20On%20The%20Show%20Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Added%20Fuel%20To%20The%20Fire" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-morencys-on-the-show-married-at-first-sight.html&description=Michael%20Morencys%20Behavior%20On%20The%20Show%20Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Added%20Fuel%20To%20The%20Fire" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./top-10-mlb-busts-in-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 10 MLB Busts in History">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mark-ingram-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mark Ingram Net Worth: Career &amp;amp; Charity">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
