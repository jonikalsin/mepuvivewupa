This trade raised many questions and sparked various speculations about the reasons behind it. In this article, we will explore the factors that led to the Bears trading Jim McMahon to the Chargers.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Jim McMahon's Career with the Bears</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jim McMahon was a key figure in the Chicago Bears' success during the 1980s. He was the starting quarterback for the Bears and played a crucial role in leading the <a href=#>team</a> to victory in Super Bowl XX in 1986. McMahon's charismatic personality and unorthodox playing style made him a fan favorite and a symbol of the Bears' success during that era.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Contract Issues</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of the primary reasons behind the trade was contract-related issues. McMahon's relationship with the Bears' management had deteriorated due to disputes over his contract. McMahon had been vocal about his desire for a new contract with improved terms, including a significant raise in salary. However, the Bears were hesitant to meet his demands, <a href=#>leading</a> to a strained relationship between McMahon and the team's management.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Injuries and Performance Decline</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Another factor that contributed to the trade was McMahon's injury history and declining performance. McMahon had struggled with various injuries throughout his tenure with the Bears, including multiple concussions and shoulder problems. These injuries had taken a toll on his performance, leading to concerns about his long-term viability as the team's starting quarterback.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Friction with Coaching Staff</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Reports of friction between McMahon and the coaching staff also emerged as a contributing factor to the trade. McMahon was known for his outspoken and rebellious nature, which sometimes clashed with the coaching philosophy of the Bears. This discord may have influenced the decision to trade McMahon, as it was essential for the coaching staff to maintain a cohesive and harmonious team environment.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Need for Change</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Bears' management may have viewed the trade as an opportunity to instigate change within the team. While McMahon had been instrumental in the Bears' past successes, the management might have believed that a fresh start was necessary to revitalize the team and address the challenges they were facing at that time.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Trade Dynamics</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The decision to trade McMahon to the Chargers could also be attributed to the dynamics of the trade market at that time. The Chargers, seeking an experienced quarterback to lead their team, may have presented an attractive trade opportunity for the Bears. This trade allowed the Bears to acquire assets or <a href=#>players</a> that they deemed valuable for the team's future, while also granting McMahon a fresh start with a new team.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>the trade of Jim McMahon from the Chicago Bears to the San Diego Chargers was influenced by a combination of factors, including contract disputes, injury concerns, performance decline, friction with the coaching staff, and the need for change within the team. While McMahon's departure marked the end of an era for the Bears, it also represented a strategic decision aimed at addressing the challenges faced by the team at that time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miln6RfrLW6ecOim2asmJp6o7HAq6pmrKKWsaZ5yaKkZqWToq6pu81mq6hlpJ2ybq%2FHmqmgnaKo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-the-bears-trade-jim-mcmahon-to-the-chargers.html&text=Why%20did%20the%20Bears%20trade%20Jim%20McMahon%20to%20the%20Chargers%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-the-bears-trade-jim-mcmahon-to-the-chargers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-the-bears-trade-jim-mcmahon-to-the-chargers.html&title=Why%20did%20the%20Bears%20trade%20Jim%20McMahon%20to%20the%20Chargers%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-did-the-bears-trade-jim-mcmahon-to-the-chargers.html&title=Why%20did%20the%20Bears%20trade%20Jim%20McMahon%20to%20the%20Chargers%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-the-bears-trade-jim-mcmahon-to-the-chargers.html&title=Why%20did%20the%20Bears%20trade%20Jim%20McMahon%20to%20the%20Chargers%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-the-bears-trade-jim-mcmahon-to-the-chargers.html&description=Why%20did%20the%20Bears%20trade%20Jim%20McMahon%20to%20the%20Chargers%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-intelligent-are-pokemon-8544.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How intelligent are pokemon? | Bulbagarden">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./red-table-talk-salma-hayek-breast-enlargement-menopause-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Salma Hayek Denies Having Breast Enlargement  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
