Cortese played basketball and American Football while in high school, and later attended the University of North Carolina from 1986 to 1990, playing as a backup quarterback for the Tar Heels but he injured his back in his sophomore year, and never played again. In 1990, Cortese graduated from the UNC with a Bachelor of Arts degree in broadcasting.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings>Career Beginnings</span></h2><p>During his college days, Cortese made his television debut in an episode of the series “General College” (1987), while a year later he appeared in three episodes of the “Something Is Out There”. After graduating from the UNC, Dan worked as the host of the Emmy Award-winning show “MTV Sports” from 1992 to 1997, but in the meantime, he was Burger King’s official spokesperson, and appeared in more than 90 commercials during the ‘90s.
