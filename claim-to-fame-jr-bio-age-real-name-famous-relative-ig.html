JR did pretty well keeping his relationship with a <a href=#>famous celebrity</a>. However, internet sleuths have been able to uncover the details.</p><p>Learn all about him and his famous relative in this article below. Below, we cover his age, real name, and his social media reach.</p><h3><strong>Meet JR, Claim To Fame Season 2 Contestant</strong></h3><p>JR starred in season 2 of Claim To Fame, and his fellow contestants were struggling to unravel who his famous relative is. The basic premise of the show is that twelve competitors, each of whom is related to an A-list celebrity, join a Hollywood house. Whoever can successfully conceal their relative’s identity for the longest wins.</p><p>His first two hints—that he has a famous brother who is also a singer—are true, but his third, which is about sports, is untrue. Additionally, some really curious Claim to Fame fans discovered JR’s family tree and his identity outside of the television show. Warning: He has another A-list sibling in the entertainment industry.</p><p>JR maintains a fairly quiet profile throughout the first several episodes. Fortunately for him, the other competitors have many more hints than he does, at least initially. The others quickly realize, however, that JR is undoubtedly not connected to an athlete because he demonstrates his lack of athletic ability when he tries to use basketball as his talent in the talent show. (<a href=#>Alprazolam</a>)</p><h3><strong>Who Is Claim To Fame JR Famous Relative?</strong></h3><p>Some internet sleuths figured out that JR is related to “Old Town Road” singer Lil Nas X. The Claim to Fame residence contains musical hints. However, JR is able to be unnoticed for the first few episodes of Season 2 because there are other relatives of musicians in that season.</p><p>Two Instagram Stories from two of Lil Nas X’s brothers—among whom is a man by the name of Robert Sleepy—were published on TikTok by a fan. JR is the first-born son of Lil Nas’s dad.</p><p>Lil Nas X was raised with ten siblings.</p><p>Lil Nas X’s parents R.L. Stafford and Shawnita Hathaway, separated when he was six years old, therefore, he has siblings on both his mother’s and father’s sides. In 2017, his mother,&nbsp;Shawnita Hathaway, passed away after her battle with heroin addiction.</p><p>Sisters Shaquisha Hill and Bianca Hill are his half-siblings on his mother’s side.</p><p>The half-siblings of Lil Nas X on his father’s side are Robert Sleepy, Ashley Stafford, and Labrock Anderson. Although Robert’s siblings aren’t as well-known as the Grammy Award-winning singer, after Claim to Fame, Robert might develop his own fan base.</p><p>Back In 2021, Robert made headlines after he supported his singer-songwriter half-brother. Robert defended his brother online after Boosie Badazz (Lil Boosie) referred to the “Industry Baby” hitmaker with homophobic slurs. Robert expressed pessimism that the “Wipe Me Down” rapper would issue an apology.</p><p>Taking to his Twitter account on Wednesday, October 27, Robert trolled Boosie as saying, “Boosie if u apologize we might give you a #1 [laughing emojis].” In a following tweet, he stressed, “Doubt it though.”</p><p>In a separate post, Robert quoted Lil Nas X’s lyrics from “Industry Baby” before bragging about his brother’s accomplishments. “Baby back aye couple racks aye couple Grammys on him couple plaques aye @BOOSIEOFFICIAL yea we not mad at all homie more hits [than] your whole trash a** catalog,” he tweeted, before offering a critique of Boosie’s recent film “<strong>My Struggle</strong>“.</p><p>“My brother [is] on his way to being a billionaire at 22 and that’s y boosie mad lol I’ll be mad too Lil $800,000 @BOOSIEOFFICIAL need to relax big homie,” Robert continued. “And I bought ya movie @BOOSIEOFFICIAL s**t was trash.”</p><p>Robert also pointed out that none of the famous people Robert is always protecting had openly backed Boosie.&nbsp;“Ain’t no celebrity defending boosie like he was defending them… Idiot,” he tweeted.</p><h3><strong>What Is Claim To Fame JR Real Name?</strong></h3><p>The real name of Claim To Fame JR is Robert “Sleepy” Stafford Jr.</p><h3><strong>Claim To Fame JR Age</strong></h3><p>As of 2023, JR from Claim To Fame is above 30 years old.</p><h3><strong>Claim To Fame JR Job</strong></h3><p>Claim To Fame’s JR states that he is an actor and TV personality on his Twitter bio. He attended Booker T. Washington High School.</p><h3><strong>Is Claim To Fame JR Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>According to JR’s Facebook, he is currently single. But he is a proud father to a ten-year-old son named Princeton Stafford.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Claim To Fame JR From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>JR hails from Atlanta, Georgia.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Claim To Fame JR?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Per his pictures, JR stands tall above the height of 5 feet 9 inches.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Claim To Fame JR On IG And Facebook?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes, Claim To Fame star JR is available on Instagram (<a href=#>@sleepdaking</a>) and Facebook (<a href=#>@robert.sleepy.5</a>).</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmnKSRnrpuwM5mnZqllWK3s3nBoqZmmZeaerOxwKVkp5mdmnqnrcyorKxlopq5osDIr5xmoZdk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fclaim-to-fame-jr-bio-age-real-name-famous-relative-ig.html&text=Who%20Is%20Claim%20To%20Fame%20JR%3f%20His%20Age%2c%20Real%20Name%2c%20Famous%20Relative&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fclaim-to-fame-jr-bio-age-real-name-famous-relative-ig.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fclaim-to-fame-jr-bio-age-real-name-famous-relative-ig.html&title=Who%20Is%20Claim%20To%20Fame%20JR%3f%20His%20Age%2c%20Real%20Name%2c%20Famous%20Relative" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fclaim-to-fame-jr-bio-age-real-name-famous-relative-ig.html&title=Who%20Is%20Claim%20To%20Fame%20JR%3f%20His%20Age%2c%20Real%20Name%2c%20Famous%20Relative" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fclaim-to-fame-jr-bio-age-real-name-famous-relative-ig.html&title=Who%20Is%20Claim%20To%20Fame%20JR%3f%20His%20Age%2c%20Real%20Name%2c%20Famous%20Relative" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fclaim-to-fame-jr-bio-age-real-name-famous-relative-ig.html&description=Who%20Is%20Claim%20To%20Fame%20JR%3f%20His%20Age%2c%20Real%20Name%2c%20Famous%20Relative" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rhony-season-14-who-is-ubah-hassan-ex-ralph-lauren-model-is-all-set-to-spice-things-up-for-the-better.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'RHONY' Season 14: Who is Ubah Hassan?
